# Cx Module Wall
This project is a very interesting way to declutter your workspace or life. It
allows you to organize your surroundings by installing boards with holes into
which modules, such as containers or hooks, can be inserted. They can be 
easily modified as the entire system is written in SCAD, so generating a vast 
number of board, container, or hook combinations is as simple as running 

```bash
make.sh!
```
